This document highlights the high level important bits of getting a KVM VFIO setup working
in order to pass a graphics card through to a Windows guest to achieve near-native
performance when gaming.

0. See the Arch Wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF) for a
   comprehensive guide.

1. See windows8.xml for libvirt virtual machine settings. Note that the path to the Pulseaudio
   socket (QEMU_PA_SERVER) will likely need to be adjusted.

2. Command line for kernel boot:
   intel_iommu=on hugepagesz=1G default_hugepagesz=1G nohz_full=2-11 rcu_nocbs=2-11

3. Enable message-signaled interrupts (MSI) for the graphics card device. This has to be done
   in the registry inside the Windows virtual machine.

4. Configure qemu (/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf) to run the virtual machine as the user who will be
   playing games in the virtual machine. This is primarily to ensure sound works via Pulseaudio.

5. Install the cpuset package from the AUR to allow reserving CPUs for the virtual machine
   only while gaming.
